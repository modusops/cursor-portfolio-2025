I was the lead product designer on this 0 to 1 initiative and worked with an incredibly small but talented engineering team to build and launch the feature. Chat is a strategic initiative to drive consumer daily direct active users to LTK while ensuring Creators have a consistent and dedicated channel to reach their audience.The project kicked at the end of Q1 2025 with an aggressive target of delivering the MVP by end of Q2 2025. I collaborated with a senior product manager and an engineeering manager driving leadership alignment on the strategy, performing benefits-risk analysis, roadmap sequencing, working with BE on architectural designs, and presentation to the leadership team including the founders/CEO.

          For the MVP, creators could only post text and link messages. Followers could send an emoji reply, but not send text replies to form threads yet. Fifty creators were selected to be a part of the initial beta launch and were given white glove support. The strategic (but risky) bet to release the Chat feature with only text support was one that we held conviction. We believed that in the short-term, Creators would be eager to bring their audience from Instagram given their algorithmic fluctuations. Furthermore, upon analyzing the fifty creators, we selected the ones who had strong followings on competitive platforms and we were sure we could deliver the next set of feature quickly. For Consumers, I fought hard to make emoji reactions a priority (over analytics). I reasoned that Consumers needed an expression mechanism that motivated Creators to continue posting in Chat.
